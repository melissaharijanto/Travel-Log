# Testing Methods

We used <a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro/">React Native Testing Library</a> and <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react-native">Jest</a> to test the components (Unit Testing). 

To run the test cases, run `npm test` on the root directory of the project.

Due to a few errors, we were not able to implement Integration Testing with the testing library (NativeEventError due to some packages used), so we decided to implement **user testing** by distributing our apk to 10 people (mainly university students) and asking them to fill in a form about its functionalities. The form is set to anonymous in an attempt to maintain objectivity of the responses. 

The results of the form can be seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jWGdPQogBsgr9BT4jBwYNIArUPwaPlW-X3HUOd_Nt8I/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. The link to the form can be seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13HqR6ZaJr3cNKarSHqOrV8jqXvz_9OpZRbYv0hLqMGw/viewform?edit_requested=true">here</a>.
