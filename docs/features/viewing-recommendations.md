#### When you press any of the tabs under `View our recommendations`:
{: .no_toc}

- The application categorizes its recommendations to three categories: `Accommodation`, `Restaurants`, `Activities`.
- Each recommendation is given an address as well as a map to show its location (as shown in the gif), as well as ratings and descriptions from its website / Google page.
- Currently, the application only provides recommendations for two locations: `Singapore` and `Surabaya`.
