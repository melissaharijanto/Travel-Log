# Travel Log

Team name: ERC11PM

Level of Achievement: Apollo

Project Scope: Mobile application with a database back-end.
Aided by React Native and Firebase, we plan to make an app that provides user authentication and visuals with various features which will be listed in detail below.

## Overview
A mobile application built to assist users in making their travel itinerary.
Made with React Native combined with Firebase to assist user authentication.

## Motivation
As avid travellers, we believe that planning your own trips would bring more freedom and flexibility in travelling as opposed to hopping in on tours. However, planning our own trip comes with a lot of hassle. Compounded with the lack of a proper trip-planning platform (opting for notes/google docs with limited planning features), detailing an itinerary might deter one’s enthusiasm of travelling.

## User Stories
1. As an avid traveler, I would like to be able to be flexible with planning my travel itinerary down to each activity, accommodation, and transport details so that I won’t waste any time.
2. As a first-time traveler, I would like to be guided on making a detailed travel itinerary.
3. As first-time travelers, we would find it easier to be guided in making my travel plans and have a place to store all the necessary documents in one place so that we won't forget them.

## Aim
We hope to provide a one-stop application that would not only ease, but also encourage people to plan their own travels – solo or in a group, starting with Singapore as our pilot country. Users could easily add their planned activities, transport, and accommodation by our built-in functions that guides them in filling in their travel details. We hope that users could spend less time making a visual, detailed travel itinerary.

## Features
1. Categorize your day-to-day activities easily with one click.
2. Rearrange your itinerary conveniently with our drag-and-drop feature.
3. Store everything related to your trip (e.g. hotel reservations, flight details) in one place.
4. The ability to access and search for past itineraries when there are places you want to revisit.

## Progress
As of submission of Milestone #1, only the front end for the Log In and Sign Up pages are finished, along with the navigations.
We would be happy if you are interested to try it out! Here are the steps to do so:
1. Please access our repository with this link https://github.com/melissaharijanto/Travel-Log and fork it.
2. Because the app is customized for android, please use the command 
```
npm start
npx react-native run-android
```
to run the app.

3. Have fun navigating through!
